        Wikipedia[note 3] is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and
        maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through
        open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing system called
        MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in
        history.[3] It is consistently one of the 10 most popular websites
        ranked by Similarweb and formerly Alexa; as of 2023, Wikipedia was
        ranked the 5th most popular site in the world.[4] It is hosted by the
        Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded mainly
        through donations.

          >Wikipedia was launched by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15,
          2001. Sanger coined its name as a blend of wiki and encyclopedia.
          Wales was influenced by the "spontaneous order" ideas associated with
          Friedrich Hayek and the Austrian School of economics after being
          exposed to these ideas by the libertarian economist Mark Thornton.[5]
          Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were
          quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than 60 million
          articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month
          and more than 15 million edits per month (about 5.7 edits per second
          on average) as of January 2023.[6][7] In 2006, Time magazine stated
          that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the
          "biggest (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world".[8].</span
